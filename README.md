A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

The To-Do List web application enables users to efficiently organize, manage, and track their tasks through a user-friendly interface, offering features like task creation, editing, filtering, and search to enhance productivity and streamline task management.

## User stories

- As a student, I want to be able to check my created to-do list so I can review my tasks easily. 
- As a student, I want to be able to add a new to-do list, with a title, time, and content so I can manage my deadlines and identify each task easily.
- As a user, I want to search for a specific task by their title, so I can easily find the task I am looking for, following with edition or deletion.
- As a user, I want to filter my to-do lists by "completed" or "pending" tasks so that I can quickly sort and view tasks based on their status, making it easier to track my progress and manage my workload efficiently.
- As a user, I want to edit my existing to-do lists so that I can modify task details and update deadlines as needed, ensuring my tasks are accurate and up-to-date.
- As a user, I want to delete tasks from my to-do lists so that I can remove irrelevant or completed items, keeping my lists clean and organized.
